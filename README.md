## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 1.14
- Pyqt5 5.15.4

## Introduction 
The study intended to take advantage of the recent development in ML approaches and attempt to build alternative and more flexible PlantEye data processing architecture. The main objective was to automatically count plants from complex canopy scans.

Our proposals combine these two mechanisms by
1. Development of a 3D point cloud segmentation algorithm to separate plants from their surroundings
2. Development of ML-based mung bean and chickpea plant detection models  
3. Evaluation of the proposed pipeline performance

## Example Results
Faster RCNN Inception-v2 and Faster RCNN ResNet50 models produced mung bean and chickpea detection results for randomly selected five test images and their original views
